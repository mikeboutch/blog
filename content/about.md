# Me 

Since I was beautiful, a long time ago! I dont have a recent picture of myself for this site.

If you want to know what I done, read my LinkedIn...

If you want to know what I was doing, read my Facebook...

But you will never know me, without meeting me!

## This site was not build only with, but also with VIM !

### A big mention to HUGO

Hugo is a static site engine written in Go.


It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [J Walter Weatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jWalterWeatherman)
* [Cast](https://github.com/spf13/cast)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/spf13). Here some fun facts about [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](http://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](http://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)
